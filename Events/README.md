Events will get pages and subdirectories here.  Within individual pages, feel free to link to the
pages of associated people, factions, locations, etc.  For example, a page about The Great Fire
might link to the page for the Factions involved in the turf war that just happened top be going on 
at the time, but is of course totally not at all related.
