# Collaborative-Setting-Experiment-1
TODO:   Name the project/game/world and fix that ugly heading and the repo name.

## What is this?
Think of this as an Open Source, system-agnostic setting for collaborative storytelling and 
world-building.  Contributors are free to add and explore any aspect of the world they feel 
like and, in doing so, help to flesh out more of the world and open up new and (hopefully) 
exciting storylines, characters, and places that no one of us would have thought up on our own.

## How do I participate?
Short version:  Read what exists in this world, get a feel for the people and places and cultures, 
and - when you have an idea of something you'd like to contribute - create or edit a page to add 
your contributions.   The idea is very similar to a wiki, but we're here to invent the world and 
its history.

Long version: A `Contributing Guide` will be added soon with some more detailed instructions on 
how to create pages and so on.

## Here are the rules for this little experiment:

### 1. Keep to the agreed genre
Which we haven't agreed on yet!  So that's the first order of business.

### 2. There will be zero tolerance for antagonistic edits or additions.  
There will be zero tolerance for hatred, bigotry, or -phobias of any kind.  "Spite Contributions" 
are also not welcome.  Keeping in mind that there is no story without conflict, this rule means 
that removing someone's contributions or "writing them out of the story" for any kind of personal 
reasons is out of the question.  If someone takes the time to invent a Faction or a Person, and 
you wish to create a rival faction or person, that is obviously fair game.  Friendly rivalries and 
friendly antagonism is fair game, so long as all involved are having fun.  Keep it in good spirit.

### 3. "Locked Pages"
Some pages will say `LOCKED` in the top title of the page.  If a page is flagged as `Locked`, 
please respect that and do not edit it or involve it in an event, location, etc. without first 
discussing it with the contributor who added it.  The flip side of that, when contributing a 
new page, please only `Lock` it if you really don't want anyone playing with it.  The point 
of this is collaboration and `Locking` a page really goes against that ideal, however this is 
an attempt at allowing contributors to have a "PC" as well so that they can tell their own 
story in the world we are creating together.

### 4. We ~~don't~~ absolutely talk about write club.   
If you have a friend, acquaintance, partner, enemy, or frenemy who you think would enjoy participating
or even just exploring the world we are creating, please let them know!

## FAQ:
### Why Github?  This is wierd.
Yeah, maybe.  But for those who are used to it, GitHub is super powerful and free.  It also tracks who 
made changes, and allows for easy reversion if we ever need to roll back a change.  Did I mention it was 
free?

### What is an `md` file?  How do I get that fun formatting like bold and underscore and stuff?
An `md` file is a pretty common format called `markdown` and you can find the full cheat sheet 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text)

### What if I only want to create characters or places and don't want to get involved in the rest?
Please do!  Please also realize that others may run away with your character or place and work it
into their stories.  Anything within this project is fair game.  If you create a character and 
introduce them to the world, anyone else who participates is free to involve them in events or 
stories as long as the known information about them makes it reasonable.   For example, a contributor 
who is fleshing out the local brothel should most likely stay away from incorporating someone else's 
local clergy without permission and/or an exceptional reason.

### I suck at naming characters, can I still play?
Please do!  For the time being, let's use the names Person-1, Person-2, Place-1, etc as "I can't 
think of a name" placeholders until someone comes up with a better Generic Naming Convention.  Any 
pages named in this way are open to naming suggestions.  Please do not change the names directly, 
message the person who created them with your ideas and let them pick.  Github has a `Discussions` 
tab which we can use for such things.

### This world is kinda neat.  What system is it for?
None.  All.  The intent here is to collaboratively invent a setting which is rules-agnostic.  To that 
end, when creating characters please describe the character and keep it more like a novel description 
rather than defining stat blocks.  You may add comments to the effect of "above-average charisma" or 
"more agile than their rival Snuffaluffagus" and the like, but try not to get too meta-gamey with it 
when possible.

### Can I use this setting for my game?
Sure!  Consider this an Open Source world setting.  **You may not publish anything from this project** 
and if you are using it for your game, we'd love for you to contribute back some of what your gaming 
group "discovers" about the world.

## When is it my turn?
Right now.  This is not a turn-based game.  If you and another contributor decide to take turns, for 
example if you and another person are collaborating on an event and each writing one side's part of 
the story, like a traditional RPG, then of course that is between you to sort out.

## I'm an Idea Person, not writer or an artist.  Can I still participate?
Sure!  In the top bar, GitHub has an `Issues` tab.  We're going to use that as a `Suggestions` list.
Feel free to submit an `Issue` with your fun idea.  Keep in mind that submitting the idea does not
necessarily commit anyone to writing it out, so try to make it something that other people can get 
excited about and want to explore with you.

## Can I contribute artwork for pages?
Sure can!  But it **MUST** be your original art.  **Do not** go scrounging DeviantArt or Google Image 
Search for pictures you think fit the concepts and upload those.  If you did not make the art, you do 
not own it, and we don't want it.
